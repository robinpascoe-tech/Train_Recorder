# Roadmap

Completed:

- Initial SOX volume tuning to reduce clipping while preserving intelligibility. Per-channel `SOX_VOLUME` overrides are supported, and the current production config lowers `freq160545` one notch below the shared default.
- Dynamic health and status reports based on configured `VOX_CHANNELS`.
- Templated `vox@...` recorder services for channel-specific recorder instances.
- Conservative Raspberry Pi installer with optional prerequisite installation and RTLSDR-Airband source build.
- Generated site configuration workflow with `site_config.sh wizard`, `generate`, `plan`, and `apply`.
- Wizard defaults sourced from existing `/etc/train-recorder/site.yaml`, with sensitive Broadcastify values masked in prompts.
- Daily empty-directory cleanup service with summarized journal output.
- Documentation refresh for the current generated-config workflow.
- Log and retention policy notes for long-running installs.
- Sanitized sample recording directory tree and filename format documentation.
- Automated shell linting with GitHub Actions and ShellCheck.
- `site_config.sh apply` preflight checks, redacted generated-file diffs, and clearer restore notes.
- Broadcastify/Icecast placeholder validation before applying generated RTLSDR-Airband config.

Near-term ideas for continued development:

- Soak-test and harden `site_config.sh apply` with real frequency add/remove changes.
- Continue monitoring SOX clipping warnings after longer soaks and adjust per-channel gain if needed.
- Add hardware documentation for antenna, RTL-SDR model, Raspberry Pi model, cooling, and power.
